Feel free to submit patches to this project if you're fixing bugs or adding enhancements that would be useful to other developers.

If, however, you're altering game content--such as adding another flipper, or replacing all the dot-matrix messages with quotes from Les Miserables--you're essentially creating a new game, in which case it might be better to fork the project for yourself.
