Professor Pinball's Castle: a pinball game written with Godot.

This 2d pinball game has a dot-matrix display, end-of-ball bonus scores, and several events, including a wizard mode. It also supports gamepads, and should run well in portrait mode if you want to try it in your digital pinball cabinet.

The game is open-source. See the attached LICENSE file for details. You can support the developer by purchasing the game at https://dbisdorf.itch.io/professor-pinballs-castle. If you like this game, you can check out my other work at https://dbisdorf.itch.io/ and at https://www.donbisdorf.com/.

I used the following open-license fonts: the OSP-DIN font, which you can find at http://osp.kitchen/, and Liberation Serif.

Apart from Godot, I used the open-source tools Audacity, Inkscape, and Krita to build this game.
