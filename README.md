# Professor Pinball's Castle.

This 2d pinball game was written using the Godot development system. The game has a dot-matrix display, end-of-ball bonus scores, and several challenge events. It also supports gamepads, and should run well in portrait mode if you want to try it in your digital pinball cabinet.

The game is open-source, and the code and license are on GitHub at https://github.com/dbisdorf/professor-pinball.

The open-source tools Audacity, Bfxr, Inkscape, Krita, and Klystrack built the graphics and music for this game. The graphics incorporate the following open-license fonts: the OSP-DIN font, which you can find at http://osp.kitchen/, and Liberation Serif.
